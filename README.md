# Snek

A framework for defining Battlesnake-compatible rulesets and board positions in
Elixir.

[Battlesnake][battlesnake] is an online competitive take on the classic game of
Snake. `Snek` provides some structure and tooling that developers can use
toward creating Battlesnake AIs in Elixir.

This project is not affiliated with or sponsored by Battlesnake,

## Status

This is an early work in progress, and should be considered experimental,
incomplete, and unstable until v1.0.0, following [Semantic Versioning][semver].

All notable changes will be recorded in the [changelog][CHANGELOG.md].
