# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][keepachangelog], and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning][semver].

Changes to this project which track compatibility with changes to the official
Battlesnake rules, which may change frequently, will not be considered a
breaking change unless it also affects the public API of this project (public
modules and functions).

This means that as long as all official changes to the rules are eventually
reflected in a new version of this project (no guarentees), then it will be
made available as either a patch- or minor-level release to help you stay up to
date automatically without updating your code. If this rule is violated, or if
there is a new official change to the rules that has not been corrected, please
[report it][issues].

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Snek.Board.move_snakes/2` and implementations of `c:Snek.Ruleset.next/3`
  officially accept either a map or a list for snake moves, and the examples
  have been changed to recommend using a map.

### Changed

- ðŸ’¥ **Breaking** - Directions have been renamed from `:north`,
  `:south`, `:east`, and `:west` to `:up`, `:down`, `:right`, and `:left`
  respectively.  This matches the directions in the official Battlesnake
  documentation.

### Removed

- ðŸ’¥ **Breaking** - Relative directions have been removed (i.e. `:forward`,
  `:backward`, `:left`, `:right`, `:northeast`, `:northwest`, `:southeast`,
  `:southwest`) Relative directions were removed to prevent confusion as
  `:left` could otherwise be interpreted as relative, for example, and we're
  changing to match the official Battlesnake nomenclature. It is also
  unnecessary to have relative direction logic in the ruleset code, as snake
  moves for a turn are always expected to be one of the four legal directions.
- Removed the `t:Snek.Ruleset.valid_move` type as it is now the same as
  `t:Snek.Board.Snake.snake_move`.

### Fixed

- Setting `apply_spawn_chance` to `0.0` was still spawning an apple on turns
  where there were no apples on the board.

### Documentation

- Corrected a typo in the documentation explaining why the two arguments are
  not commutative in `Snek.Board.snake_collides_with_other_snake?/2`.
- Clarified the behavior of `Snek.Board.move_snakes/2` and
  `Snek.Board.move_snake/3`, specifically that it only moves alive snakes (as
  was already the case), and that the default move is now always `:up` (not the
  snake's previous direction).

### Performance

- Improved performance of `Snek.Board.within_bounds?/2` and
  `Snek.Board.move_snakes/2`, which improves overall performance in all
  rulesets as these are frequently called functions.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-05

### Added

- Added `:backward` as a valid direction (relative to the snake's orientation)
  for `Snek.Board.Snake.step/2` and `Snek.Board.Snake.move/2`, which complements `:forward` and can
  be used for a snake to throw a game by running into their own neck.

### Fixed

- In the `Snek.Ruleset.Standard` ruleset, snakes will not be eliminated by
  colliding with snakes who are already eliminated. This was always supposed to
  be the case, but some collisions with dead snakes were still being detected.
- In the `Snek.Ruleset.Standard` ruleset, all alive snakes will move, even if a
  move is not specified for every snake. Snakes without a move specified will
  default to moving `:north` if it is the first move, otherwise continue in the
  same direction they were already going. Previously, snakes without a move
  specified did not move at all, which was not the correct behavior and could
  cause invalid self-collision eliminations.
- Corrected typespec for `Snek.Board.move_snake/3`.

### Changed

- Updated the documentation to clarify that snakes will not be moved if they
  are already eliminated.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-09-05

### Changed

- In the `Snek.Ruleset.Standard` rules, snakes eating on their
  last turn will survive now. Previously they would be eliminated from
  starvation despite the food being eaten. This change also makes it so that
  head-to-head collisions on food still remove the food. This updates
  compatibility with [this change in the official Battlesnake
  rules.](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/commit/a342f87ed6c18f16d3d0fc099d94d047e31d4611)

## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-30

### Added

- A `Snek.Board.Snake.step/2` function for finding points relative to a snake's
  last moved direction, but without moving the snake.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-30

### Added

- A `Snek.Board` module (and submodules) for representing board positions.
- A `Snek.Ruleset` behaviour module for implementing variations of game rules.
- A `Snek.Ruleset.Standard` module implementing the Battlesnake Standard rules.
- A `Snek.Ruleset.Solo` module implementing the Battlesnake Solo rules.
